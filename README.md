# VersatileHDPMixtureModels

Placeholder for the Python wrapper for the Julia code in https://github.com/BGU-CS-VIL/VersatileHDPMixtureModels.jl 
which in turns contains the code for our UAI '20 paper titled "Scalable and Flexible Clustering of Grouped Data via Parallel and Distributed Sampling in Versatile Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes".
